# üß† AutoDocAI: Intelligent README Generator

AutoDocAI is a developer-first tool that simplifies the process of writing a high-quality README for your software projects. It automatically scans your source code, understands key components, and generates a professional README document that reflects your project's core functionality, features, and usage.

Whether you're maintaining open-source projects, building MVPs, or just want to save time, AutoDocAI helps you turn code into clear documentation with minimal effort.

## ‚ú® Features

‚Ä¢ Scans project directories and extracts top-level context from code comments and structure  
‚Ä¢ Generates an elegant and informative README using a large language model  
‚Ä¢ Supports Python and can be extended to other languages easily  
‚Ä¢ Lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate into any project  
‚Ä¢ Fully customizable output based on user-defined prompts

## üìÇ How It Works

AutoDocAI follows a simple but powerful pipeline:

1. **Code Parser**: It reads through your source files and extracts key segments such as function headers, class definitions, and inline comments.  
2. **Prompt Generator**: The extracted content is formatted into a coherent prompt that highlights the essence of your code.  
3. **AI-Powered Writer**: The prompt is passed to a language model which generates a comprehensive README including an overview, features, installation steps, and usage.  

This system bridges the gap between code and documentation, producing output that is both developer-friendly and beginner-accessible.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/autodocai.git
cd autodocai
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Ensure you have access to an AI API key such as OpenAI's GPT models. Store your key in an environment variable for secure access:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

## üöÄ Usage

To generate a README for your project, simply run:

```bash
python autodocai.py /path/to/your/project
```

You can also specify a custom prompt template:

```bash
python autodocai.py --path ./my_project --template ./my_prompt.txt
```

The generated `README.md` file will be saved in your current directory.

## üõ† Customization

You can tailor the tone, format, and sections of the README by editing the prompt template file. Include sections like:

‚Ä¢ Project Overview  
‚Ä¢ Features  
‚Ä¢ Installation  
‚Ä¢ Usage  
‚Ä¢ Contribution Guidelines  
‚Ä¢ License Information
